### Description
Currently, the dotfiles focus on `bash`. This issue aims to add support for other popular shells like `zsh` and `fish`.

### Tasks
- Create separate configuration files for `zsh` and `fish`.
- Add installation instructions for each shell.
- Test compatibility across different systems.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the configurations are modular and easy to maintain.
- Document how to switch between shells in the README.
