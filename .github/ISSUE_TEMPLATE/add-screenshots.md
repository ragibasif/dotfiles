### Description
To make the repository more user-friendly and visually appealing, we should add screenshots of the dotfiles and customizations in action. This will help users understand how the configurations look and function in a real-world environment.

### Screenshots to Include
1. **Terminal Customizations:**
   - Showcase the terminal emulator (e.g., `kitty`, `alacritty`) with custom themes, fonts, and prompt styles.
   - Include examples of common commands being used (e.g., `ls`, `git status`).

2. **Neovim/Vim Setup:**
   - Display the editor with a sample file open, showcasing the color scheme, plugins, and keybindings.
   - Highlight features like file navigation, syntax highlighting, and LSP integration.

3. **tmux Configuration:**
   - Show a tmux session with multiple panes and windows.
   - Highlight custom keybindings, status bar customization, and session management.

4. **Git Customizations:**
   - Demonstrate custom Git aliases and prompts in action.
   - Show a sample workflow (e.g., committing changes, viewing logs).

5. **Other Tools:**
   - Include screenshots of any other tools or customizations (e.g., `bash` prompts, `zsh` themes, etc.).

### Requirements
- Screenshots should be high-quality and clearly showcase the customizations.
- Add captions or annotations to explain key features or configurations.
- Ensure the screenshots are consistent in style (e.g., same terminal size, font, and color scheme).

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the screenshots could be organized in the README:
